# Machine Learning Subject
Projects made for the subject of machine learning.

Only two projects were made for this subjects: one applying neural network to the IRIS dataset, and one applying three machine learning methods learned through the course to a dataset chosen by me.
All projects use the scikit-learn library for the methods.

## Second Pproject
This project uses the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques dataset from Kaggle.

The goal was not to use regression to predict prices as intended but to see if it was possible to predict a classification method if it was applied.
Two types of division of the dataset was made: one relative to the a set interval of prices, other to a set interval of instances.

The following methods were applied:
  - Logistics Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Neural Network

Unfortunately, the results were not great as the precision was too low.
